<p>In conventional project management, the planning phase must be masterfully crafted because any changes made thereafter are considered errors of the planning phase. The conventional approach changes a bit when you consider how agile works, but we’ll get to that later. One such consideration that must be taken into account in the planning phase is the project’s scope. </p>

<p>A project’s scope can be defined as a meticulous blueprint that serves as a guide for a team’s objectives, deliverables, and tasks within the project’s domain. A project’s scope must either adhere to stringent constraints or specifically delineate tasks that are outside of the scope’s parameters. Failure to employ these measures may bring about the calamitous “scope creep.” </p>

<p>Scope creep can be defined as unanticipated modifications to a project that transcend the criterion previously established in the planning phase. While some scope creep can be rather beneficial to an end product, make no mistake that its implications are rather insidious. Scope creep can lead to overallocation of resources, timetable disruptions, deviation from the project’s original purpose, and other noxious repercussions. </p>

<p>I myself have had first-hand experience with scope creep via a 48-hour game jam. If you don’t know what a game jam is, basically my partner and I had 48 hours to make a video game from scratch. The project grew to encompass too many ideas and systems that we did not plan for. We ended up submitting a half-hearted product, not an uncommon occurrence during these short game jams. </p>

<p>Agile, while being a flexible methodology, well-positioned to avoiding malignant scope creep, is unfortunately not impervious to it. So raises the question, how do we manage the scope in an agile project? Keep in mind that we are concerned with establishing a clearly defined scope, which ideally would avoid scope creep, give deliverables a reasonable timeline, and allocate resources as precisely as possible, all tasks that are easier said than done. </p>

<p>One such way to manage the scope of an agile project is to use a work breakdown structure(WBS). The purpose of a WBS is to provide an organized representation of the project’s scope. It is a hierarchal structure which serves as an instrument to deconstruct the overarching tasks at hand into smaller, more granular, and digestible elements. A WBS is a common thing used in project management and is versatile enough to be adapted for use within agile methodologies. Higher priority tasks take place at the top of the hierarchal continuum, with tasks becoming lesser in priority as you descend the WBS.  This is, however, one iteration of a WBS with numerous alternative variations existing.</p>

    Let’s break down what exactly goes into a WBS:
    <ul>
        <li>Scope Decomposition: This is the highest level of the WBS. It represents the project’s main deliverables and goals. These can then be chunked down into smaller more manageable components. </li>
        <li>User stories and Tasks: These are small, self-contained units of work that give value to an end-user. User stories are prioritized and assigned to the agile team for implementation. The user stories are then further broken down into sub-tasks as needed. </li>
        <li>Visuals: There are various project management tools available to help represent what the entire structure should look like. Looking at a visual of a WBS can aid the agile team in understanding the scope, progress, and work that is going into a project. </li>
        <li>Flexibility: This is especially important within the context of agile where the project is constantly being iterated on. New tasks such as user stories can be added. The scope can be adjusted to accommodate changing requirements. Just be wary that scope creep can encroach on a project despite the flexible nature of agile.  </li>
        <li>Fitting it into an agile context: WBS can be aligned with agile principles by focusing on key aspects of the agile methodology such as iterations on tasks, responding to customer needs, and promoting collaborative efforts. Tasks can be broken down into small pieces that can be iterated on. </li>  
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Changes going into an agile project can be added to a backlog. However, there are several things to consider when adding new items to the backlog. The backlog items should undergo prioritization, a process driven by the characteristics of the work being undertaken. Items placed atop the WBS should possess comprehensive clarity and depth, facilitating a thorough comprehension by agile team members regarding the reasoning for their elevated priority. Remember that team members should never be placed into a sprint without well defined and lucid objectives. The introduction of changes during the midst of an iteration should be minimized or, ideally, ousted altogether. </p>

    Let’s take a look at some project management software’s that can help us manage a project’s scope:
    <ul>
        <li>Jira is a popular choice for project management, and it has support for different agile methodologies like scrum and kanban. It has features that make creating and managing user stories and sprints much easier. </li>
        <li>Trello is an intuitive and visual way to manage agile projects, it uses boards, lists, and cards to represent tasks. It has support for agile in the form of sprint planning and backlog grooming. </li>
        <li>Asana is a versatile project management tool that can be adapted for agile. It uses boards and lists to create organized tasks and assign them to team members. </li>
        <li>VersionOne is specifically designed for agile project management. It has features for backlog management, sprint planning, and tracking progress. </li>
        <li>Targetprocess is a flexible agile project management tool that supports various agile frameworks. </li>
    </ul>

<p>There are many more project management software’s available to use. If this list isn’t tickling your fancy, feel free to do your own research and find the tool that’s most applicable to your project and team. </p>

<p>In conclusion, agile scope management is characterized by its adaptability and flexibility in response to changing customer needs. It allows projects to remain responsive in dynamic environments. Agile encourages continuous improvement. Teams learn from each iteration or sprint and apply those learnings to enhance future scope considerations. Agile puts a strong emphasis on customer needs. By aligning the scope with the customer’s values, the end product is more likely to meet the customers’ expectations. Applying all these principles should, in practice, empower the agile teams to deliver products within the scope that maximize the success of the project. </p>
